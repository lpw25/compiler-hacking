It's time for the twelft Cambridge OCaml compiler-hacking evening! This time we're heading to the new Jane Street offices in London for an [Flambda](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on#flambda-projects) themed session.

If you're planning to come along, it'd be helpful if you could **indicate interest [via Doodle](Jeremy could you fill this in)** and sign up to the [mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking) to receive updates.

_**Where**_: Jane Street (30th Floor), 20 Fenchurch Street London, EC3M 3BY United Kingdom

_**When**_: 6pm, Monday 30th November

_**Who**_: anyone interested in improving OCaml. Knowledge of OCaml programming will obviously be helpful, but prior experience of working on OCaml internals isn't necessary.

_**What**_: fixing bugs, implementing new features, learning about OCaml internals

_**Wiki**_: https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki

We're defining "compiler" pretty broadly, to include anything that's part of the standard distribution, which means at least the [standard library](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/stdlib), [run](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/byterun)[time](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/trunk/asmrun), tools ([ocamldep](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/depend.html), [ocamllex](https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html), [ocamlyacc](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual026.html), etc.), [camlp4](https://github.com/ocaml/camlp4), [ocamlbuild](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual032.html), the [documentation](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-manual), [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), and the [compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) itself. We'll have [suggestions for mini-projects](https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on) for various levels of experience, but feel free to come along and work on whatever you fancy.

Drinks and finger buffet will be provided.
